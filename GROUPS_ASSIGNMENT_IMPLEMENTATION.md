# 🚛 Groups and Assignment System Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview
Implementation plan for the Choferes (Truck Drivers) groups and document assignment system with workflow tracking, GPS monitoring, and signature mapping.

## 🗃️ Database Schema
✅ **Created**: `db/groups-and-assignment-system.sql`

### Tables Created:
1. **groups** - Manage different types of groups (Choferes, etc.)
2. **user_group_memberships** - Users assigned to groups
3. **document_assignments** - Main assignment workflow (Conduces)
4. **assignment_comments** - Communication during assignments
5. **assignment_gps_tracking** - GPS tracking for deliveries
6. **assignment_signature_mappings** - Signature placement definitions
7. **assignment_status_history** - Track status changes
8. **assignment_files** - Additional files (photos, receipts)

## 🔧 Implementation Components Needed

### 1. Server Actions (app/actions/)
```
assignment-actions.ts     - CRUD operations for assignments
groups-actions.ts         - Group management operations

/assignments/                     - All assignments dashboard
/assignments/[id]/                - Individual assignment details
/my-assignments/                  - Assignments for current user (chofer view)
```

### 5. Database Types (types/)
```
assignment-types.ts               - TypeScript interfaces for all tables
```

## 🚀 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Database & Basic CRUD)
1. ✅ Create database schema
2. Create server actions for basic operations
3. Create API routes
4. Create TypeScript types

### Phase 2: Groups Management
1. Groups manager interface
2. User-to-group assignment
3. Choferes group setup

### Phase 3: Document Assignment Core
1. Assignment modal with basic functionality
2. Chofer selection from groups
3. Assignment creation and status tracking

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Comments system
2. GPS tracking and maps integration
3. Signature mapping interface
4. File attachments

### Phase 5: UI Integration
1. Add "Assign" buttons to Mis Documentos
2. Assignment dashboard
3. Mobile-friendly chofer interface
4. Real-time updates

## 📱 User Interface Flow

### For Document Owners:
1. **Mis Documentos** → Click "Assign" → Opens Assignment Modal
2. **Assignment Modal Tabs**:
   - **Información**: Select chofer, set delivery details, due date
   - **Comentarios**: Add instructions and communicate
   - **Mapa**: View GPS tracking (after assignment)
   - **Firmas**: Configure signature placement

### For Choferes (Truck Drivers):
1. **My Assignments** → View assigned documents
2. **Assignment Details** → See delivery info, add comments
3. **GPS Tracking** → Automatic location recording
4. **Document Signing** → Sign at predefined locations

### For Administrators:
1. **Groups Management** → Manage Choferes group
2. **Assignment Dashboard** → Overview of all assignments
3. **Reports** → Assignment statistics and tracking

## 🗺️ GPS and Mapping Features
- Real-time location tracking during delivery
- Route history visualization
- Geofenced delivery confirmations
- Integration with mapping APIs (Google Maps/Mapbox)

## 💬 Comments System
- Internal comments (admin only)
- Public comments (visible to chofer)
